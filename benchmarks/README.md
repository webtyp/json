# JSON Benchmarks

This directory contains benchmarking tools to compare JSON against the standard library `encoding/json` when compiled to WebAssembly using TinyGo.

## Build Script

The `build.sh` script compiles the WASM binaries with different JSON implementations.

### Usage

```bash
# Build with JSON (default)
./build.sh

# Build with encoding/json (stdlib)
./build.sh stlib
```

# Run the benchmark server

```bash
# Start the local server to serve the compiled WASM
go run ./web/server.go
```

You can then open `http://localhost:8080` in a browser to see the benchmark results.

### Output

The compiled WASM binary is output to `web/public/main.wasm`.

The script will display:
- Uncompressed binary size
- Gzipped size (for realistic deployment comparison)

## Source Files

- [`clients/tinyjson/main.go`](clients/tinyjson/main.go) - Implementation using JSON
- [`clients/stdlib/main.go`](clients/stdlib/main.go) - Implementation using encoding/json (stdlib)

Both files implement the same functionality to ensure fair comparison.

## Performance Results

Last updated: 2026-07-11 (after fixing `fmt.JSONEscape` to bulk-copy safe byte
runs instead of writing one byte at a time — see `fmt/docs/PLAN.md`; average
of 3 runs, `go test -bench=. -benchmem -count=3 ./tests/...`)

### Go Benchmark (`go test -bench`)

| Benchmark | webtyp/json | encoding/json | Faster | Δ allocs |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|--------|----------|
| Encode    | 604 ns/op 80 B/op 1 allocs | 799 ns/op 80 B/op 1 allocs | +24% | 0 |
| Decode    | 1503 ns/op 125 B/op 5 allocs | 3098 ns/op 376 B/op 8 allocs | +51% | -3 |
| RoundTrip | 2315 ns/op 221 B/op 7 allocs | 3923 ns/op 376 B/op 8 allocs | +41% | -1 |

> Run: `go test -bench=. -benchmem ./tests/...`
>
> Before the `JSONEscape` fix, Encode was essentially tied with stdlib
> (753 ns/op vs 758 ns/op) — a CPU profile (`go tool pprof`) found
> `fmt.JSONEscape` writing one byte at a time accounted for 43.75% of Encode's
> CPU time, most of it spent re-escaping static, always-safe JSON field names
> on every call. Fixing it to bulk-copy safe runs (mirroring how
> `encoding/json` scans for the next special character) dropped `JSONEscape`
> out of the profile entirely and made Encode ~24% faster than stdlib instead
> of a wash.

### WASM Binary Size

Compiled with `tinygo build -target wasm -no-debug -opt=z`.

| Implementation | Uncompressed | Gzipped |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **webtyp/json** | **51 KB** | **20 KB** |
| encoding/json (stdlib) | 270 KB | 118 KB |

> Run: `./build.sh` (webtyp/json) and `./build.sh stlib` (stdlib) from this directory.

### Analysis

**webtyp/json is 83% smaller gzipped** (20 KB vs 118 KB) making it ideal for web apps where bundle size matters. By eliminating the `reflect` package, it not only significantly reduces the final WASM binary size, but also makes **encoding ~1.3x faster**, **decoding ~2.1x faster**, and **roundtripping ~1.7x faster** than the standard library.

**Use webtyp/json when:** Bundle size and raw decoding performance are critical, or running in restricted WASM environments.
**Use Stdlib when:** You need to work dynamically with arbitrary unknown schemas (like `map[string]any`), as webtyp/json is optimized strictly for predefined structs (`fmt.Encodable`/`fmt.Decodable`).

See the [main README](../README.md#benchmarks) for detailed benchmark results.
